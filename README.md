Whats-desktop

This is a wrapper for the What's App web client. This is a way for me to learn the Electron APIs and have something for me to use. All are welcome to fork this since I can not 
guarantee that I will be on top of this once I get this to fufill all of my needs.

Building

On my Arch/Antergos system, I have simply cloned repository cd'ed into 
it and run npm install && npm start

Contributing

Again, I can not guarantee that I will be on top of this and so I may 
not be ontop of accepting anything sent to me here.

==Priorities==

I will continue reading the electron documentation and fix any issues 
that have been poping out in my terminal

Notifications - It's in the docs somewhere

Have it load straight to the whatsapp website instead of loading a 
redirect
