# Whats-desktop

This is a wrapper for the What's App web client. This is a way for me to learn the Electron APIs and have something for me to use. 
All are welcome to fork this since I can not guarantee that I will be on top of this.

# Building

On my Arch/Antergos GNU/Linux system, I have simply cloned the repository, cd'ed into
it, and run npm install && npm start

# Contributing

Again, I can not guarantee that I will be on top of this and so I may
not be on top of accepting anything sent to me here. You're welcome to fork!

# Priorities

I will continue reading the electron documentation and fix any issues that have been poping out.

Tray icon - have something in the system tray so to tell the user that this is running

Notifications - It's in the Electron docs somewhere
